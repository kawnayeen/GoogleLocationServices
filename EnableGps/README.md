Enable Gps
==========

Example project to show how to turn on gps in single step. Even if user allowed location permission, 
if gps isn't turned on; android app will not get precise location data. So for those app, that are sensitive 
to location should prompt the user to turn on gps, otherwise prevent the user from using the sensitive functionality.
